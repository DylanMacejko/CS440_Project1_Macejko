The test.cpp file compiles with the proper compilation command, with absolutely no
warnings. This then produces an a.out executable which runs accordingly.

(P.S. I created a duplicate copy of my Deque.hpp code prior to macro translation,
labled premacroDeque.hpp. This is included in the directory).
